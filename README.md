Hello,

welcome to Github repo.

This is just a small application on how to use GraphQL using Apollo Server.
This demonstrates my knowledge of GraphQL and also servers as a template for people trying to understand GraphQL.

Future scope: Use Apollo client provider to use the GraphOL querries in a React.js application.
